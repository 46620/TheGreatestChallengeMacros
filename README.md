# BTD6 macro 1920x1080
This program is for people with a screen resolution of 1920x1080. The cursor moves to each position based on how many pixels it is from the top left corner. If your screen resolution is not 1080p, use the BTD6 Macro Variable file.

## BTD6 macro Variable
This program **should** work for any screen resolution as it took the cursor positions from the 1080p file, and turned them into percentages. I only tested it on my computer, so other resolutions might not work. If it does not work for you, I recommend going through the 1920x1080 file and changing the pixel counts until it is clicking the desired positions. This variable file also outputs your screens resolution if you run it in Visual Studio Code, you can use this to help you with editing the 1920x1080 file.
